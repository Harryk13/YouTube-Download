You have two options for installing the extension:
1. Double click on the youtube-download.crx file;
2. Or go to the extensions page in Chrome, and click on Load unpacked extension..., then choose the folder "youtube-download".

After you install it, when you visit a video page on youtube's domain (e.g. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0-SJNnnHFM) the extension will load directly. It'll display a green box at the top of the page that contains all the available download links along with their resolutions and formats.

Important:
I made this extension because my internet connection is a bit slow, and I can't enjoy watching videos because they're buffering very slowly. So now I download the videos I want to watch, and watch them whenever I want, and then delete them.

I guess what I am saying is: Please, do not use this extension for any thing that would violate any copyrights.
